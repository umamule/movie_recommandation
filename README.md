Movie Recommendation System – Description
        A Movie Recommendation System is an intelligent application that predicts and suggests movies to users based on various inputs such as their past viewing history, ratings, genre preferences, and demographic data. These systems are widely used in entertainment platforms like Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, Hulu, and others to personalize user experiences and increase engagement.

Purpose
        The primary goal of a movie recommendation system is to filter and present content that matches a user’s taste, saving them time and improving user satisfaction.

Types of Recommendation Techniques
    A.  Content-Based Filtering:
       1. Recommends movies similar to those the user has liked in the past.
       2. Considers movie features like genre, director, cast, keywords, etc.
            Example: If a user likes sci-fi movies, it will suggest other sci-fi titles.

    B. Collaborative Filtering:
        Recommends movies based on the preferences of similar users.

        Types:
          1.User-Based: Finds users with similar tastes and recommends what they liked.
          2.Item-Based: Finds movies liked by similar users and suggests them to you.
                Example: "Users who watched Inception also liked Interstellar."

    C.Hybrid Filtering:
        1.Combines both content-based and collaborative filtering for better accuracy.
        2.Overcomes limitations of individual techniques.



Key Components
    1.User Data: Viewing history, ratings, preferences.
    2.Movie Database: Includes metadata like genre, actors, director, release year.
    3.Recommendation Engine: Algorithms to match users with relevant movies.
    4.User Interface: Platform where users receive and interact with suggestions.


Technologies Used
    1.Programming Languages: Python,
    2.Libraries & Frameworks: Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Surprise, Pandas
    3.Databases: SQL, NoSQL (MongoDB), MovieLens dataset
    4.Machine Learning: Clustering, Classification, Matrix Factorization (e.g., SVD)



Applications
    1.Streaming platforms (Netflix, Disney+)
    2.Online ticket booking (BookMyShow, Fandango)
